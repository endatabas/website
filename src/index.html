            <!-- Endatabas solves two small problems, in the grand scheme of things: storage
                 and retrieval. -->
            Endatabas is an immutable database.
            It profits from today's confluence of scale-out computing power, limitless
            disk space, and machine learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Contemporary to this watershed moment in technology is one of cultural
            understanding.
            Developers respect open source software.
            Operators value Software as a Service.
            Both know the virtues of immutable data.
          </p>

          <!--
               <p>
               We want to build you a database you will enjoy. You type on your favourite
               keyboard in an editor that feels like home, or write with your favourite pen
               in a notebook so familiar it's family. We want to create that feeling —
               not a product you've purchased but a tool you will use to create something
               weird, interesting, or fun.
               </p>
          -->

          <p>
            <!-- Endatabas is an immutable database. -->
            <!-- (Tacit destructive writes are vestigial.) -->
            Dynamic, semi-structured data is native to Endatabas.
            Temporal queries are effortless.
            <!-- The Endatabas SQL dialect draws inspiration from SQL:2011, SQL:2016,
                 and
                 <span title="SQL:2023 is an upcoming standard.">SQL:2023</span>
                 specifications, making it a sequel all its own. -->
            <!-- — both in SQL and its storage engine. -->
            <!-- — both in SQL and its storage &amp; execution engines. -->
            The storage and execution engines embrace the decomposition storage model.
          </p>

          <p>
            <!-- Endatabas is dynamic SQL in the Clouds.
                 A sharp tool with a firm grip, is meant to stay out of your way. -->
            We hope you will enjoy building with Endatabas as much as you enjoyed
            writing <!-- running (?) -->  your first program.
          </p>

          <p>
            We will sell Endatabas as a service and release everything as open source.
          </p>
