          <h2>SQL Document Database with Full History</h2>

          <p>
            Endatabas is an open source immutable database.
            It benefits from today's confluence of scale-out computing power, limitless
            disk space, and machine learning.
          </p>

          <p>
            We hope you will enjoy building with Endatabas as much as you enjoyed
            writing your first program.
          </p>

          <p>
            We will sell managed Endatabas as a service but it will always be
            open source and you can <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.endatabas.com/tutorial/quickstart.html">try it today</a>.
          </p>
