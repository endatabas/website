5. Color Model: White-on-Black or Black-on-White
6. Pattern: Circle
7. Period: 3.00 to 4.00
8. Angle: 75.0 is a good default but play a lot
9. OK

== B. Colorize

1. On Duplicate: Colors > Color to Alpha
2. Color: White or Black (depends on A.4: if Black-on-White, then Black)
3. Select Yellow or Black as foreground and/or background color
4. Add Layer + move between other layers
5. Fill With: Yellow or Black (foreground/background)
6. On Duplicate: Lock Alpha Channel (checkerboard icon)
7. Select foreground color
8. Click-and-drag color onto "dots"
