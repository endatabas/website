Steven Deobald's .plan for Dec 02, 2023
-----------------------------------------

* finished 3 copies of the investment memo
* set up matrix and discord servers (matrix is private)
* Strange Loop Slack, Reddit, and Hacker News all had endb mentions
* added plausible.io to endatabas.com
* sketched the pitch deck and started working on it in earnest

HÃ¥kan and I had a long conversation today around 128/256-bit Decimals in Arrow and, kind of unrelatedly, date/time types which track timezones. Timezones I honestly don't care about ... I acknowledge the TigerBeetle / Joran Dirk Greef perspective that TZ is essential to correct time storage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayG7ltGRRHs (23:00) ... but I give it a pass for now, since a second column suffices. Decimals, on the other hand, seem valuable for a "simple" currency data type. Unfortunately, Arrow will store Decimals of various precision as different types, which is untenable. One option is a SQL Server style `MONEY` type, but with a higher precision than 4? We parked Decimals for now/again.

TODOs:

* [x] add twitter / mastodon / youtube? / discord to .com
* [x] add an "executive summary" to the "Why?" document
    * 'What Goes Around Comes Around'
    * collapsing the toolchain
    * timing: stop repeating ourselves (past) + land next-50-years tech as early as possible (future)
    * link "Why?" doc from docs intro
    * reply in HN thread, mention Discord, ask for feedback: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38484654
* [ ] local plausible.io js? (the current one is ad-blocked, for good reason)
    * [ ] switch to Netlify?
* [x] finish pitch deck
* [ ] revisit memos
* [ ] blog
* [ ] W3COSS
* [ ] AIGPL-4.0
