          <!-- Endatabas solves two small problems, in the grand scheme of things: storage
               and retrieval. -->
          Endatabas is an immutable database.
          It profits from today's confluence of scale-out computing power, limitless
          disk space, and machine learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Contemporary to this watershed moment in tech is one of cultural
          understanding.
          Developers respect open source software.
          Operators value Software as a Service.
          Both know the virtues of immutable, dynamic data.
        </p>

        <!--
             <p>
             We want to build you a database you will enjoy. You type on your favourite
             keyboard in an editor that feels like home, or write with your favourite pen
             in a notebook so familiar it's family. We want to create that feeling —
             not a product you've purchased but a tool you will use to create something
             weird, interesting, or fun.
             </p>
        -->

        <p>
          <!-- Endatabas is an immutable database. -->
          <!-- (Tacit destructive writes are vestigial.) -->
          The Endatabas SQL dialect draws inspiration from SQL:2011, SQL:2016,
          and
          <span title="SQL:2023 is an upcoming standard.">SQL:2023</span>
          specifications, making it a sequel all its own.
          Temporal queries are effortless.
          Dynamic, semi-structured data is native to Endatabas.
          <!-- — both in SQL and its storage engine. -->
          <!-- — both in SQL and its storage &amp; execution engines. -->
          The storage and execution engines embrace the decomposition storage model.
        </p>

        <p>
          <!-- Endatabas is dynamic SQL in the Clouds.
               A sharp tool with a firm grip, is meant to stay out of your way. -->
          We hope you will enjoy building with Endatabas as much as you enjoyed
          writing <!-- running (?) -->  your first program.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will sell Endatabas as a service and release everything as open source.
        </p>
