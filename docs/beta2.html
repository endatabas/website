        <p>
          We would like to participate in the small revolution currently underway.
          Computing is fun again. Or it soon will be.
          We want to be here when our species rediscovers that the computer is a
          limitless tool of the imagination.
        </p>

        <p>
          We want to solve a small problem, in the grand scheme of things: storage.
          Today, there is a confluence of scale-out computing power, limitless
          disk space, machine learning, and cultural understanding. There exists
          also an industry appreciation for open source software, immutability,
          dynamic data, and Software as a Service.
        </p>

        <p>
          We want to build you a database you will enjoy. You type on your favourite
          keyboard in an editor that feels like home, or write with your favourite pen
          in a notebook so familiar it's family. We want to create that feeling —
          not a product you've purchased but a tool you will use to create something
          weird, interesting, or fun.
        </p>

        <p>
          Endatabas is an immutable database. (In fact, we believe that to be the only
          true database. A database with destructive writes seems dishonest, doesn't it?
          It's a peculiar vestige, if nothing else.)
          SQL is the query language family we will support but the Endatabas SQL dialect
          will draw inspiration from SQL:2011, SQL:2016, and the upcoming SQL:2023
          specifications, so it will be a sequel all its own. Temporal queries will be
          effortless. Dynamic, semi-structured data will be native. We will sell
          Endatabas as a service and release every line of code we write as open source.
