I often find it useful to write my thoughts down instead of simply
thinking about them or discussing them out loud. HÃ¥kan may also find
this to be useful -- I'm not sure. Hence the `Author` key.

I see no point in locking these thoughts up in a private repository,
but I also see no point in publicly proclaiming our daily thoughts
about the design of Endatabas. This file is readable, but it is not
necessarily intended to be read.

This document is top-down, immutable, and unmaintained.
