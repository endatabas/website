  abstract = {Both RDBMS and NoSQL database vendors have added varying degrees of support for storing and processing JSON data. Some vendors store JSON directly as text while others add new JSON type systems backed by binary encoding formats. The latter option is increasingly popular as it enables richer type systems and efficient query processing. In this paper, we present our new native JSON datatype and how it is fully integrated with the Oracle Database ecosystem to transform Oracle Database into a mature platform for serving both SQL and NoSQL style access paradigms. We show how our uniquely designed Oracle Binary JSON format (OSON) is able to speed up both OLAP and OLTP workloads over JSON documents.},

  abstract = {Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) have been very successful at managing structured data with well-defined schemas. Despite this, relational systems are generally not the first choice for management of data where schemas are not pre-defined or must be flexible in the face of variations and changes. Instead, No-SQL database systems supporting JSON are often selected to provide persistence to such applications. JSON is a light-weight and flexible semi-structured data format supporting constructs common in most programming languages. In this paper, we analyze the way in which requirements differ between management of relational data and management of JSON data. We present three architectural principles that facilitate a schema-less development style within an RDBMS so that RDBMS users can store, query, and index JSON data without requiring schemas. We show how these three principles can be applied to industry-leading RDBMS platforms, such as the Oracle RDBMS Server, with relatively little effort. Consequently, an RDBMS can unify the management of both relational data and JSON data in one platform and use SQL with an embedded JSON path language as a single declarative language to query both relational data and JSON data. This SQL/JSON approach offers significant benefits to application developers as they can use one product to manage both relational data and semi-structured flexible schema data.},

  abstract = {Relational database systems have traditionally optimized for I/O performance and organized records sequentially on disk pages using the N-ary Storage Model (NSM) (a.k.a., slotted pages). Recent research, however, indicates that cache utilization and performance is becoming increasingly important on modern platforms. In this paper, we first demonstrate that in-page data placement is the key to high cache performance and that NSM exhibits low cache utilization on modern platforms. Next, we propose a new data organization model called PAX (Partition Attributes Across), that significantly improves cache performance by grouping together all values of each attribute within each page. Because PAX only affects layout inside the pages, it incurs no storage penalty and does not affect I/O behavior. According to our experimental results (which were obtained without using any indices on the participating relations), when compared to NSM: (a) PAX exhibits superior cache and memory bandwidth utilization, saving at least 75\% of NSM's stall time due to data cache accesses; (b) range selection queries and updates on memory-resident relations execute 1725\% faster; and (c) TPC-H queries involving I/O execute 1148\% faster. Finally, we show that PAX performs well across different memory system designs.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present the data manipulation facility for a structured English query language (SEQUEL) which can be used for accessing data in an integrated relational data base. Without resorting to the concepts of bound variables and quantifiers SEQUEL identifies a set of simple operations on tabular structures, which can be shown to be of equivalent power to the first order predicate calculus. A SEQUEL user is presented with a consistent set of keyword English templates which reflect how people use tables to obtain information. Moreover, the SEQUEL user is able to compose these basic templates in a structured manner in order to form more complex queries. SEQUEL is intended as a data base sublanguage for both the professional programmer and the more infrequent data base user.},

  abstract = {Future users of large data banks must be protected from having to know how the data is organized in the machine (the internal representation). A prompting service which supplies such information is not a satisfactory solution. Activities of users at terminals and most application programs should remain unaffected when the internal representation of data is changed and even when some aspects of the external representation are changed. Changes in data representation will often be needed as a result of changes in query, update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored information.Existing noninferential, formatted data systems provide users with tree-structured files or slightly more general network models of the data. In Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed. A model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced. In Section 2, certain operations on relations (other than logical inference) are discussed and applied to the problems of redundancy and consistency in the user's model.},
